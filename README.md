# ArduinoMega2560_K3NG_Keyer_SMT

A version of the K3NG Morse Code Keyer, redrawn and built with SMD
components and pin header connections.

I intend to recreate the [K3NG Morse Code
Keyer](https://groups.io/g/radioartisan/files/K5BCQ%20-%20MEGA%202560%20MINI%20K3NG%20K5BCQ%20KEYER),
using SMT components, for automated manufacturing of the board. I also
plan to place all input and output devices, such as jacks, switches,
LCD displays, LEDs, etc. off-board, and connect to them using 0.1 inch
pitch pin headers.

I will reproduce all the current (as of 12 March 2024) functionality
of the keyer. In addition, I'd like to allow use of a USB-based
keyboard (in addition to the PS/2 style, which is increasingly hard to
find).

I will also connect all unused pins of the Arduino Mega2560 clone to
strips of 2-3 0.1 inch pads, to allow future enhancements and
experimentation.
